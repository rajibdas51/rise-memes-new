          a. Investment Risk: Purchasing cryptocurrencies, including $RISE,
          carries inherent risks. Prices can be highly volatile, and you may
          lose all or part of your investment. We do not provide investment
          advice, and you are solely responsible for your investment decisions.

          b. Security: You are responsible for maintaining the security of your
          wallet and private keys. TheRiseOfMemes is not liable for any losses
          or damages resulting from your failure to secure your assets properly.
        </p>

          c. Regulatory Compliance: Cryptocurrency regulations vary by
          jurisdiction. It is your responsibility to comply with the laws and
          regulations in your area regarding cryptocurrency use.

        <p className='text-[#fff1de] text-shadow-effect-para font-[500] font-cinzel text-sm md:text-lg text-left md:text-left no-scrollbar'>

          value, stability, or future performance of the $RISE token.

          e. Claim of Tokens: Claiming the $RISE tokens after the end of the
          presale can only be done with the same wallet from which they were
          purchased in the presale. In the event of losing access or the
          compromise of the wallet, you agree that we are not responsible for
          your loss, nor can we allow you to claim from a different wallet since
          we do not undergo any KYC procedures when enabling purchases during
          the presale. The only exception to this is if the transaction has been
          completed via a verified third-party service, in which case you will
          need to contact us to verify your identity.
